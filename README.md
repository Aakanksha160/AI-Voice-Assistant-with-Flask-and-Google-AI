# AI-Voice-Assistant-with-Flask-and-Google-AI
This project builds a real-time AI-powered voice assistant using Python, Flask, and Google Generative AI. It integrates speech recognition for voice input, processes user queries, and provides intelligent responses. The assistant also tracks the conversation history dynamically, offering a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Overview

Learn how to build a real-time AI-powered voice assistant using Python, Google Generative AI, Flask, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to integrate voice commands, process user input, and display a dynamic conversation history in a web app. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional AI voice assistant capable of understanding speech and providing intelligent responses in real time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Voice Input**: The assistant listens to your voice and processes it to generate responses.
- **Google Generative AI**: Powered by Google's AI technology for intelligent and concise responses.
- **Dynamic Conversation History**: Keeps track of both user queries and AI responses.
- **Speech Synthesis**: The AI responds audibly to the user.
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses JavaScript's SpeechRecognition API to recognize user speech and send it to the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend is powered by Python with Flask for handling web requests.
- **Google Generative AI**: Used for generating intelligent responses based on user queries.
- **Flask**: A Python web framework used for creating the backend of the web app.
- **JavaScript**: Handles voice input and output, dynamically updating the conversation history.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the front-end user interface.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Recognition**: When the user clicks on the microphone button, the browser listens for the user's speech using the `SpeechRecognition` API.
2. **Request to Backend**: The user's speech is sent to the Flask server, where Google Generative AI processes it and generates a response.
3. **Dynamic UI Update**: The web page updates with the AI response and stores the conversation history.
4. **Voice Response**: The AI speaks its response back to the user using the browser's `SpeechSynthesis` API.
